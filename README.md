## Development

I developed the client using React. Used React Router and functional components. Primarily used SASS and Bootstrap to style everything. Used React hooks for state management, and a little bit of Redux for global data such as signed-in user information. Used Axios to make API requests.

Developed REST API using Node and Express. Used MongoDB Atlas for database.
